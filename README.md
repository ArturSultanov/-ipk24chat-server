# IPK24-CHAT Server Documentation

IPK Project 2 - IOTA: Chat server.

## Overview

The IPK24-CHAT Server is a robust chat server application built using .NET 8. It is designed to facilitate real-time text communication between clients over the internet. The server is capable of handling custom `IPK24-CHAT` protocol messages and supports both TCP and UDP transport protocols, offering flexibility and reliability in client-server communication.

This application is designed with a focus on networking aspects, ensuring that multiple clients can connect and interact seamlessly in different chat channels. The server adheres to a defined finite state machine (FSM) for managing states and transitions based on client interactions, conforming to the custom protocol specifications.

### Features

- Supports concurrent handling of multiple client connections over TCP and UDP.
- Implements custom message types such as `AUTH`, `JOIN`, `MSG`, `ERR`, and `BYE` as per the `IPK24-CHAT` protocol.
- Ensures graceful session termination with appropriate use of FIN (TCP) and message confirmation (UDP).
- Allows for dynamic chat channels where clients can join, leave, and exchange messages.
- Includes command-line arguments for server configuration, including IP, port, and protocol-specific settings.
- Logs all incoming and outgoing messages in a consistent and readable format to the standard output stream.

### Built With

- [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0): A free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

## Getting Started

### Build

The project employs a Makefile for building, showcasing how .NET Core projects can integrate with traditional Unix-like build systems. Compilation is straightforward with the provided make command, adhering to .NET Core's build conventions

The program can be build using the `make` command.

```bash
make
```

### Usage
The following command will run the server:

```bash
./ipk24chat-server [-l <listening Ip>] [-p <listening port>] [-d <timeout>] [-r <retries>]
```

Here is an example of how to start the server with custom IP and port:

```bash
./ipk24chat-server -l 192.168.1.5 -p 4567
```

## Theoretical Background

Understanding the core differences between the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC793] and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC768] is essential for grasping network communication concepts. 
Both protocols serve the purpose of sending data over the internet, but they operate differently.

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

TCP is a connection-oriented and reliable protocol[StevensTCP]. It guarantees the ordered delivery of data as it was sent. This reliability is achieved through a series of mechanisms:

- **Connection Establishment**: TCP establishes a connection using a handshake process, ensuring both parties are ready to communicate.
- **Data Sequencing**: Each byte of data sent over a TCP connection is numbered, which allows the receiver to reassemble data in the correct order.
- **Acknowledgments and Retransmissions**: Receivers send back acknowledgments for data received. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment, it will retransmit the missing data.
- **Flow Control**: TCP uses windowing and other techniques to control how much data is sent and to prevent overwhelming the receiver.
- **Congestion Control**: Algorithms like TCP congestion control are used to detect and mitigate network congestion.

In TCP, the data stream is a sequence of bytes, which means that a read operation from a TCP socket could return:

- Just a part of the message if the entire message has not been received yet.
- Several messages at once if they are queued in the buffer, requiring the application-level protocol to determine the boundaries of each message.

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

In contrast, UDP is a connectionless and unreliable protocol[UDPAuburn]. It does not establish a connection before sending data and does not guarantee message delivery. The key characteristics include:

- **No Connection Overhead**: UDP does not perform a handshake, making it faster for scenarios where speed is prioritized over reliability.
- **No Intrinsic Order**: Messages (datagrams) might arrive out of order, or not at all, and it's up to the application to handle these scenarios.
- **No Acknowledgments**: UDP does not have an acknowledgment mechanism for sent datagrams, and senders are unaware if their messages reach the destination.

UDP handles messages independently of one another:

- Every read from a UDP socket retrieves exactly one message as it was sent. The protocol ensures that messages are isolated; a read operation will never return a partial message or multiple messages at once.
- Because of its stateless nature, UDP is often used in streaming, gaming, and any application where the timely arrival of data is more crucial than its absolute reliability.

### Conclusion

The choice between TCP and UDP depends on the requirements of the application. TCP is suitable for applications that require high reliability, and where it's critical to receive complete and ordered data. In contrast, UDP is suitable for applications that can tolerate some loss of data but require faster and more efficient transmission, such as live audio or video streaming.

In the IPK24-CHAT server application, the implementation of both TCP and UDP allows the server to cater to clients that prioritize reliability (TCP) as well as those that require less overhead and potentially faster communication (UDP).


## Project Overview
My purpose was to design the chat server application which can handle multiple clients simultaneously over both (TCP and UDP) protocols, providing robust chat functionality, including real-time messaging and session management. 
Itâ€™s structured to be highly modular and scalable, with clear separations of concerns among handling connections, processing messages, managing user sessions, and handling system-wide settings and user commands.

## Testing:

### Telnet Check:

To verify that the server is operational and accepting connections, the `telnet` command was used:

```
[xsulta01@ipk24 ~/test-client/ipk24chat-client]$ telnet 0.0.0.0 4567
Trying 0.0.0.0...
Connected to 0.0.0.0.
Escape character is '^]'.
```
This output confirms that the server is actively running and capable of accepting client connections.

### Wireshack Check:

For validating that the server adheres to the `IPK24-CHAT` protocol specifications when sending messages, 
Wireshark was employed along with a custom Lua dissector script `ipk24-chat.lua` provided by the Instructors.  
The following table captures sample network traffic, demonstrating the server's protocol compliance:

### Summary
The tests conducted provide a broad validation of the serverâ€™s ability to handle different communication protocols and adhere to the IPK24-CHAT protocol. 
Both low-level connectivity tests using Telnet and protocol-specific message format checks using Wireshark have confirmed the server's operational effectiveness and compliance with the required standards.


### Conclusion

The IPK24-CHAT Server, developed as IPK Project 2 - IOTA, is a comprehensive chat server application constructed using .NET 8. 
It has been intricately designed to support real-time text communication across the internet, handling both TCP and UDP protocols with finesse. 
This server manages multiple client connections simultaneously.
The application is capable of processing and conforming to the `IPK24-CHAT` protocol messages which include operations such as user authentication `AUTH`, joining channels `JOIN`, message exchanges `MSG`, error handling `ERR`, gracefully terminating sessions `BYE`, and confirmation messages `CONFIRM` for UDP purposes. 
Through these functionalities, it ensures a dynamic interaction environment where clients can seamlessly join or leave chat channels, exchange messages in real-time, and perform all these actions under the guidance of a well-defined finite state machine (FSM).
The server's implementation demonstrates a strong understanding of network programming principles, including the nuanced differences between TCP and UDP protocols. 
This knowledge is crucial as it influences the choice of protocol based on the application requirementsâ€”TCP for reliability and order, UDP for efficiency and lower overhead.
